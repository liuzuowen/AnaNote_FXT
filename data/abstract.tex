In this note, we present the measurement of anti-flow of mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3-3.9 GeV 
with the STAR experiment under its fixed target configuration at RHIC. 
Directed flow and elliptic flow of $\pi$, $K_S^0$ and $\Lambda$ are presented in different centrality, transverse momentum and rapidity intervals. 
$\pi^+$ and $K_S^0$ show anti-flow at low $p_T$($p_T <$ 0.6 GeV/c) at 3-3.9 GeV. And the result have been compared with JAM model.
Anti-flow of mesons at low $p_T$ could be explained by shadowing effect from spectaor.
