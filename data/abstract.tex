In this note, we present the measurement of anti-flow of kaons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 GeV 
with the STAR experiment under its fixed target configuration at RHIC. 
Directed flow of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $K_S^0$, p, and $\Lambda$ are presented in different centrality, transverse momentum and rapidity intervals. 
$\pi^+$, $K^{\pm}$, and $K_S^0$ show anti-flow at low $p_T$ ($p_T <$ 0.6 GeV/c) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 GeV.
And the result have been compared with JAM model.
Anti-flow of kaons at low $p_T$ could be explained by shadowing effect from spectator.
