\section{Summary}

We present directed flow measurement for $\pi^{\pm}, K^{\pm}, p$ and $K^0_S, \Lambda$
in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, and 3.9 GeV.
The $p_T$ dependence of $v_1$ slope in the mid-rapidity shows
that there is anti-flow at low $p_T$ ($p_T <$ 0.6 GeV/$c$ ) for $\pi^{+}$ and kaons ($K^{\pm}, K^0_S$) in the mid-central 10 - 40\% collisions.
By contrast, the baryons (proton and lambda) don't show anti-flow at low $p_T$.
Moreover, the centrality dependence of $dv_1/dy$ shows
that more negative $v_1$ slope is observed in the more peripheral collisions.
It indicates that the anti-flow might be caused spectator shadowing effect.
At last, the JAM model calculation can reproduce anti-flow at low $p_T$ without incorporating kaon potential.
With the data measurement and model calculation,
we conclude that the spectator shadowing effect can lead to anti-flow of kaons, no need of the earlier claimed kaon potential.
